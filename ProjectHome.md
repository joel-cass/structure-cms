Structure CMS is a content management system that does not require a database, is simple, extensible and built with best practises in mind. The administration system is simple and easy to use, and content can be output in any format desired - HTML, XHTML, RSS, JSON etc.

The system originally started as a framework for building websites, hence it has developers' best interests in mind. It includes the modules framework, which can be used to build any forms or interactive interfaces you may need. The API is object-oriented and easy to understand. Quirks have been kept to a minimum.

The default installation comes with almost everything you need to get started. A default layout including top nav, sub nav, and breadcrumb modules. A contact form. A search engine (yes, that's right). So what else could you need.
